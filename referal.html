      Any fraud or abuse concerning the program is subject to reversal of referral reward. A fraud encompasses:
      If a user is found referring himself using multiple IDs or phone numbers.
      If a user is found making multiple successful referrals and redeeming his/her referral rewards and then a majority of his/her Referees return/cancel their orders.
      Any other attempt to take unfair advantage, as deemed by us
